# DrankBank

I. Overview
------------

Drank Bank is the latest productivity app for keeping track of all your alcoholic endeavors! 
From “I’ve had how many drinksh?” to “what is the best wine under 1000 HUF”, 
you can use Drank Bank as a drinking diary, inputting what drinks you’ve had when,
how you’d rank them, and where you’ve had them.  In addition to keeping your own liquor cabinet database,
the app will also query establish databases to give rankings of any categorized alcohol. 

DrankBank is our final Android project for Mobile Software Development
with Professor Peter Ekler at Aquincum Institute of Technology.
DrankBank is developed on Android Studio by Veronica Child, Thu Nguyen, and Mario See.

   then type of alcohol. If the alcohol can be found from the APIs, then
   all pertinent information associated with it will be filled in. Else,
   the user will have the option to add to their local database.
