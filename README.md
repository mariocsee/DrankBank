# Drank Bank

Drank Bank is the latest productivity app for keeping track of all your alcoholic endeavors! 

From “I’ve had how many drinksh?” to “what is the best wine under 1000 HUF”, you can use Drank Bank as a drinking diary, inputting what drinks you’ve had when, how you’d rank them, and where you’ve had them.  In addition to keeping your own liquor cabinet database, the app will also query establish databases to give rankings of any categorized alcohol. 

DrankBank is our final Android project for Mobile Software Development with [Professor Peter Ekler](https://www.aut.bme.hu/en/Staff/tyrael) at the [Aquincum Institute of Technology](http://www.ait-budapest.com/). DrankBank is developed on [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) in Java by Veronica Child and [Mario See](http://mariocsee.com/).

## Design

a. Opening Screen: Login/Register Screen
- Google OR Facebook sign-in

b. Landing Screen: Upon registration, the main screen will be a dairy

c. Adding entries: Users may add entries

   - Setting alcohol: There will be multiple drop down options. Users will
   first select the type of alcohol from a drop down menu, then brand,
   then type of alcohol. If the alcohol can be found from the APIs, then
   all pertinent information associated with it will be filled in. Else,
   the user will have the option to add to their local database.
